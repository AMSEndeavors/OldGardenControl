# OldGardenControl
Past watering control algorithms - written for Particle Photons.

Three programs, used for three situations:
   * Dispensing liquid fertilizers and other plant nutrients
   * Watering an indoor "garden" in a small grow tent
   * Watering an outdoor garden on a balcony

Fertilizer dispenser used a color OLED display plus two push-button interface. 
Watering algorithms had no user interface beyond LED status lights tied to functional pins (e.g. tank water level switches / pump motor control inputs)
